***Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.***

*A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.*
